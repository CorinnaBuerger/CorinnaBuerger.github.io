Welcome to my Covid Viewer!
You can select any country in the world to be displayed in the plots below. 
The gray bars in the background represent worldwide data. The selected country will be displayed in blue.

The first plot gives information about the daily death cases, the second one about the total ones.

{% include bokeh.html %}


Plots that display the daily and total cases of infection will follow soon!
