I"V<p>Have you ever wondered what’s behind the mysterious expressions <code class="highlighter-rouge">*args</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">**kwargs</code>?
Usually they are used as function parameters, when you don’t know the amount of given arguments yet. Let’s say you want to define a function <code class="highlighter-rouge">mean</code> that returns the mean of all the numbers, that are passed to it. Surely, you want to create a function that can be applied for all amounts of numbers. In this case, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">*args</code> as a parameter.</p>
