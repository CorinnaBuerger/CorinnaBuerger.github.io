	    <span>Welcome to my Python Adventures! It feels like yesterday when I had no idea about coding. Since you don't learn it at school and my profession -- at least at first sight -- had nothing to do with it my computer skills were little. But one day I met a person who introduced me into the world of coding. And by writing 'world' I mean it. I never knew that there is such an exciting universe. At some days I get lost in there for hours and still know so little. On this website I will share some of my discoveries. I hope that you have an interesting time spent here or at least some fun. Also check out </span><a href="https://danielschuette.github.io">this</a><span> cool website belonging to the person who got me here!</span>
